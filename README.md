# MiniLang Parser (Python)
This repository implements a basic scanner and parser for MiniLang, a small educational language designed to demonstrate core programming concepts. MiniLang supports:

- Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Variable assignments: Assigning values to named variables.
- Conditional statements (if-else): Executing code based on conditions.
- Printing: Displaying values to the console.
## Current functionalities:

- Scanner: Identifies tokens like integers, identifiers (variable names), operators (+, -, *, /, =, ==, !=), keywords (if, else, print), comments, and whitespaces.
- Parser (Top-down): Analyzes the structure of MiniLang code based on predefined grammar rules. Parses basic statements like assignments, if-else constructs, and print statements.
## Limitations:

- Limited error handling (basic syntax checks).
- Does not handle complex language features or advanced control flow statements.
## Work in progress:

This is an ongoing project focused on core parsing functionalities. Future development will aim to:

Implement robust error handling with informative messages.
Extend parsing capabilities to handle more complex language features.
